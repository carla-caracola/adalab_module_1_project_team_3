# Traditional Games in Python: Hangman, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and Trivia Game

## üìù Project description

Welcome to the **The Cheetah Girls - Nostalgic Games** project. This repository contains three classic childhood games developed in Python: Hangman, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and a Trivia game. Each game has been carefully designed to provide an authentic and nostalgic experience, using Python to implement the logic and ensure smooth and entertaining gameplay.

The project was developed by the team "The Cheetah Girls" during Module 1 of the Data Analytics Bootcamp by Adalab.

## üïπÔ∏è Games included

### 1. Hangman

Hangman is a classic game where you have to guess a word letter by letter. You have a limited number of attempts before the little man is "hanged".

#### Features:

- Validation of answers and player scoring.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è Agile Development

The development of these games followed an agile methodology, allowing for rapid iterations and continuous code improvement. Key practices used included:

- **Scrum:** Daily monitoring meetings, sprint planning, and sprint reviews.

## ‚öô Build with

**Python** as Primary Tool Key and **Jupyter Notebook**. Python features used in this project include:

- **Random module:** For random selection of words and moves by the computer.
- **Control Structures:** Loops and conditionals for game logic.
- **Lists and Strings:** For data manipulation and game states.
- **User Interaction:** Use of `input` and `print` for data input and output.
